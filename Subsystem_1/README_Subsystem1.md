# This is the README for the Subsystem_1

## Main Script

---

The subsystem_1.m MATLAB script should be run. This file will display four different results:

1. Local search with fmincon to find local minimisers.
2. Local search with fmincon updated for discrete variables to find local minimisers.
3. Global search with fmincon to find global minimisers.
4. Local search with genetic algorithm to fit the discrete variables. 

All results are displayed by running the main file subsystem_1.m

## Execution time

---

The execution time for each algorithm is the following respectively:

1. 0.046776 s
2. 0.030286 s
3. 0.417 s
4. 0.307 s

Being the total 0.78 s. 

## Dependencies

---

The script requires only MATLAB_R2018A.
